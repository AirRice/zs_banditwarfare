<b>谁将活下去？</b> <br>
<p><h3>在《土匪战争》中有三种游戏模式。</h3></p>
<hr>

<p>Points are obtained by doing various activities including killing enemies, assisting your teammates, or capturing transmitters. They are also given out after each round depending on the result of the last wave.</p>
]]

LANGUAGE.help_cont_introduction_transmission		=	[[<h2>传输模式</h2> <br>
<p>In Transmission, you are tasked with controlling transmitters around the map in order to send a signal for reinforcements before the other team.</p>
<p>Both teams have the same objective: to finish the transmission. If a team finishes the transmission first they win the wave. At the end of the game the team with more waves won wins overall.</p>
<p>Once a wave begins, several transmitters appear around the map. If you stand next to a transmitter you slowly start to capture it. Having several team members near you in the capture zone increases the speed at which you capture it. Each transmitter is able to transmit 0.5% of the overall transmission progress every second while they are controlled.</p>
<p>Remember that the transmitters are the most important thing in this mode! You cannot win if you do not control them, even if you kill members of the opposite team. Conversely, you will lose if the enemy controls transmitters for too long, even if you kill them all! There are several tools available to aid you in capturing them or preventing enemy control.</p>
<p>You can open the weapon loadout menu by pressing and holding the Garry's Mod spawnmenu key ('Q' by default). In this menu you can click each weapon slot to purchase other weapons, replacing the one in the slot with it. Unless you purchase weapons in your loadout before the wave starts, they will not be given to you immediately. However, every time you respawn you will spawn with all the weapons in your loadout.</p>
<p>In Transmission you can use all special tools in the game. EMP guns can help you shut down an enemy transmitter, stopping them from transmitting temporarily. A backdoor may be used to immediately take over an enemy transmitter while reducing their progress. Drones can be used to capture transmitters remotely while protecting another side of the map.</p>]]

LANGUAGE.help_cont_introduction_collection			=	[[<h2>收集模式</h2> <br>
<p>Collection mode involves the two teams attempting to collect blood samples for a potential zombie vaccine.</p>
<p>Both teams have the same objective: to add enough samples for the vaccine. If a team adds enough samples first they win the wave. At the end of the game the team with more waves won wins overall.</p>
<p>Samples can be earned by killing enemies. If the killing blow was a headshot this will make them drop twice the samples. If they were holding any samples, they will all be dropped upon dying.</p>
<p>Every 30 seconds, a zombie nest may spawn randomly on the map. Finding and destroying them gives some points, as well as making them drop 10 samples.</p>
<p>Simply collecting the samples is not enough. You need to find a research terminal and insert the samples into them. Standing near the research terminals will automatically insert the samples at a rate of 2 per second, but you cannot insert them into a terminal if there are any enemies within its radius.</p>
<p>You can open the weapon loadout menu by pressing and holding the Garry's Mod spawnmenu key ('Q' by default). In this menu you can click each weapon slot to purchase other weapons, replacing the one in the slot with it. Unless you purchase weapons in your loadout before the wave starts, they will not be given to you immediately. However, every time you respawn you will spawn with all the weapons in your loadout.</p>
<p>In Collection mode some tools and weapons are especially useful. Biometric scanners, alongside their usual purpose, displays any zombie nest locations as well. Bioweapon ammunition is readily dropped by zombie nests when they break, making these weapons especially useful in this mode.</p>
<p>This mode makes getting up close and personal with your enemies more valuable, as long range sniping will not net you samples!</p>]]

LANGUAGE.help_cont_introduction_deathmatch			=	[[<h2>死亡竞赛模式</h2> <br>
<p>In deathmatch mode there are no transmitters and the only objective is to kill the entire enemy team. You cannot use loadouts in this mode and everything is purchased using one simplified shop. Here, purchasing weapons and other tools will give them to you directly.</p>
<p>With deathmatch the entire game is faster paced, most tools are unavailable, and you have less time to complete the objective (which is to kill all enemies). Fortunately, all purchases are 30% cheaper!</p>
<p>You will also drop your weapons on death for the enemy to collect at their leisure, although there are specific circumstances:</p>
<ul><li>Weapons that show up as blue are <strong>"Insured"</strong>: You will not lose them upon death.</li> 
<li>Weapons will not be insured the first round you purchase them, but purchasing a weapon and surviving the following round holding it will insure them.</li>
<li>This works similarly when regarding upgrades too: Weapons will not be insured the first round you upgrade to them, but if the previous tier was insured you will get that previous weapon back even if you die and lose the upgraded weapon.</li>
<li>Consumables such as grenades or flashbangs, and tools such as force fields that you place into the world, will never be insured. You will lose these every time.</li>
<li>Weapons you do not buy, such as those you get by picking them up from the ground, will never be insured. You cannot upgrade them or refund them for points either!</li>

While holding the prop down, using the hammer's secondary attack or shooting the nailgun will nail the prop to whatever is behind it at the moment. Two props nailed together can move with each other, so to make a sturdy barricade props need to be nailed to stationary targets such as walls and floors.<br>
Hitting the prop with a hammer will repair it. Holding down the 'run' key (Default: Shift) will display all nails' current healths, given that they are nailed down by friendly players or yourself.
If a prop has been nailed down by mistake, or if you simply want to move the prop somewhere else, simply press the 'reload' key (Default:R) holding the hammer to pull out any nails placed by friendly players or yourself.
The health of the barricade depends on the props' mass and volume. A large, heavy prop has more health than small props.</p>

<p>The 'Aegis' Barricade kit is a tool to quickly place a barricade on sturdy static surfaces. By turning the red indicator which tells you where the planks will go, you can place the planks by simply firing the kit. The indicator will turn green if you can place down the plank.<br>
Each plank placed down will use up one plank. These planks are different from nailed planks as they are treated like other placeables. Alongside turrets and forcefields, clever usage of these placeables alongside nailed barricades is a good way to build a sturdy barrier to control enemy movement.</p>

<p>Tips:
<ul>
<li>You can block pathways with heavy props but you won't be able to phase past them if they aren't nailed down. Remember to nail them down to finish the barricade!</li>
<li>Large, heavy props are good for barricades as the barricade will have more health, as well as allowing for more space for nails. You can put up to three nails into one prop, and each nail will increase its health.</li>
<li>Carpenter's Hammers are one of the most useful weapons ever. They can be used to build barricades, repair turrets and other placeables, restore turret ammunition, and even get rid of EMP effects on transmitters. An aspiring engineer should most certainly take one.</li>
<li>Barricades cannot be repaired indefinitely. Past a certain threshold barricades cannot be repaired, and once a barricade prop's health goes down to zero, it will break after a short period, being unable to nail back down. In other words, props are the limiting factor of barricades.</li>
<li>There are many methods of combating barricades. Weapons that deal AoE damage, such as explosives, can harm multiple props at once. Sledgehammers do more damage to barricades and placeable tools, and a crowbar can remove nails from barricades by hitting them. EMP guns can dissole all barricade nails entirely from a prop by shooting it.</li>
<li>Leaving holes inside your barricades for shooting at enemies is a good way to keep attacking the enemy while giving yourself some cover. Building a barricade in a strategic location, such as to block off pathways, is a surefire way to gain a strategic edge over your opponents.</li>

<p><h3>The purchase system in ZS:Bandit Warfare is a tier-based system, where weaker weapons can be "upgraded" into stronger ones.</h3></p>
<p>You can trade in previous weapons for a price and obtain a better one. Often these are straight improvements but some weapons have properties unique to them. You may also revert to a previous, weaker weapon and get half the points you would have used to upgrade to the new weapon originally refunded. Keep in mind that you cannot do this with weapons picked up off the ground, such as weapons given to you by allies or obtained from enemies in Deathmatch mode.</p>
<p>A short summary of each weapon type may be found below.</p>

<p><h3>手枪</h3><p>
<p>Pistols are divided into three large categories: Fast, Accurate and Split.</p>
<p>The <b>Fast Pistols</b> offer high fire rates with often low individual damage. Some of these, such as the <i>Terminator</i> or <i>Eraser</i>, have quirks that make them quite strong but unwieldy and unable to consistently deal high damage. Overall, this line of weapons is handy as a backup even later on.</p>
<p>The <b>Accurate Pistols</b> offers higher power at the cost of somewhat low firing speed. These are highly accurate and can be used for long range engagements, and are a good option as backup alongside shotguns and the like.</p>
<p><b>Split Pistols</b> fire several bullets per shot. This technically reduces the overall accuracy but provides a wider effective cone of fire.</p> 
<p>The <b>Split</b> and <b>Accurate</b> routes merge into the <i>Ventilator</i>, which offers both options. It has very high power per shot and good accuracy, and can also fire its entire clip like the previous split shot pistols if necessary.</p>
<hr>
<p><h3>霰弹枪</h3><p>
<p><b>Shotguns</b> fire a wide spread of many bullets. Each bullet has low damage potential on its own, but shotguns are extremely powerful up close.</p>
<p>Shotguns are further split into ones that shoot slower, but with much more power per shot (<i>Severance</i>), and automatic shotguns that fire quickly (<i>Albatross</i>).</p>
<hr>
<p><h3>突击步枪</h3><p>
<p><b>Assault Rifles</b> are automatic weapons with comparatively high accuracy. They are designed to be used while stationary and most of them will lose accuracy while moving. They are characterised by above average fire rate and high per-shot damage. Some of the higher tier assault rifles are equipped with scopes as well.</p>
<hr>
<p><h3>冲锋枪</h3><p>
<p><b>SMGs</b> are a counterpart to assault rifles with a much faster firing rate on average but much lower accuracy. Unlike assault rifles, many of them are designed to work while on the move and get less accuracy debuffs while moving. While SMGs have lower per shot damage, the fire rate means that the overall potential damage output is higher.</p>
<p>Some later tier SMGs are more balanced in this regard, losing some advantages while mitigating some downsides (<i>Reaper</i>).</p>
<hr>
<p><h3>步枪</h3><p>
<p><b>Rifles</b> are built for long range engagements, boasting high damage but very low fire rates. Most of them are equipped with a sniper scope to aid aiming. Deliberate aiming is key to these weapons.</p>
<p>Some of these rifles are modified to fire more quickly, while dealing less damage on hit. These are more suitable for cases where getting a clear shot may not always be viable.</p>
<hr>
<p><h3>十字弩</h3><p>
<p><b>Crossbows</b> are primarily projectile weapons. Depending on the crossbow used these may have properties such as bouncing on surfaces, impaling through multiple targets or causing bleeding. Thus, crossbows are often hard to clearly define as a weapon type. Because all of these throw projectiles forward, they can pierce through anti-bullet measures such as forcefields. However measures to mitigate projectiles such as interceptors do exist.</p>
<hr>
<p><h3>生化武器</h3><p>
<p><b>Bioweapons</b> are an offshoot of projectile crossbows with distinct characteristics. The projectiles fired by these weapons are repurposed zombie biotechnology and have the same characteristics as poison of zombies. These will melt enemies into flesh that can be picked up for more ammunition, as well as being suited for high burst damage. This is because zombie poison is rapidly healed after the enemy sustains damage from it.</p>
<p>Because most bioweapons are built to fire many projectiles in a short timespan, they can overwhelm anti-projectile measures.</p>
<hr>
<p><h3>脉冲武器</h3><p>
<p>Although <b>Pulse Weapons</b> share the same ammunition type, they are all very different from one another. The true potential of pulse weapons is that they utilise the upgrade system to its fullest. Pulse weapons can seem to fit into any of the other categories of weapon. However, they can upgrade to a variety of other pulse weapons, and this allows a much faster change between weapon types than using the other categories.</p>
<p>There are many entry points into the pulse weapon line, from various different other weapon types. It can be beneficial to pivot using pulse weaponry between weapon types.</p>
<hr>
<p><h3>医疗武器</h3><p>
<p><b>Medical Weapons</b> are dual-purpose weapons used to both heal allies and hurt enemies. Usually this is done by overdosing the opponent and causing damage over time. Some medical weapons fire projectiles while others simply fire standard bullets. However, they can all be used to heal allies in one way or another.</p>
<p>Medical Weapons, much like medical kits, can be used to remove harmful status effects from allies, given that the amount healed is sufficiently large.</p>
