### Story (If you're into that kind of thing...)
The devastating Zombie outbreaks, which led to hulking beasts and otherworldly monsters threatening mankind, has been put to rest. Whether by tenacity or pure miracle, the humans have survived to see another day
. However a new threat looms on the horizon, this time from within. The people have gathered into organised militias arming themselves with the same weaponry used to destroy the zombies all those years ago. 

Wrestling for control over the newly emerging zombie vaccine, as well as control over communications and logistics networks over the world, the Bandits have struck back at whatever coalition attempted to serve as the leaders of the remaining humans. Both sides have their guns now pointed at their ex-comrades who once fought alongside them against insurmountable odds. 

Will you help lead the side you now find yourself on to victory? Will you help the bandits take back what is rightfully theirs, or will you purge the traitors once and for all?

## Gamemode Information
Bandit warfare is a PVP gamemode built over the foundation of Zombie Survival. It takes inspiration from other team-based shooters such as Counter-Strike, Team Fortress 2, or the Battlefield series. It is both my humble homage and love letter to ZS after years of tinkering with its code for a server I moderated. 

As such, I intend for it to have the same "vibe", for lack of a better term, as Zombie Survival. Many HUD elements and weapon designs are identical as a direct homage, while others have been modified to match the more fast-paced and strategic gameplay.

The gamemode has been built with the ideology that the #1 issue with most Garry's Mod servers is the sheer number of assets that must be downloaded beforehand. This gamemode wishes to push the boundaries of what can be done with the base assets, and directly combat the "addon bloat" that is often prohibitive for good gameplay. It has been thoroughly tested to work with **only HL2 (Mounted by default within Garry's Mod) and CS:S mounted.**

### Features

 - Fight as 2 separate teams pitted against each other over various objectives.
     - Collect biological samples from fallen enemies and comrades to fuel the zombie vaccine research effort.
     - Capture and hold transmitters for long enough to contact the rest of your allies faster than the enemies can.
     - ...Or just clear the area of all enemy activity! The last team standing wins!
 - Utilise a variety of different weapons, all designed to tailor to a specific feature or niche. Progress your weapons through the upgrade tree to reach weapons with devastating power.
 - Supplement your arsenal with various tools that can turn the tide of battle, from handheld interceptors that reflect back enemy projectiles to EMP guns that can halt enemy transmission progress.
