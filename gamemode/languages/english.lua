<b>Who will survive?</b> <br>
<p><h3>There are three game modes in Bandit Warfare.</h3></p>
<hr>

<p>Points are obtained by doing various activities including killing enemies, assisting your teammates, or capturing transmitters. They are also given out after each round depending on the result of the last wave.</p>
]]

LANGUAGE.help_cont_introduction_transmission		=	[[<h2>Transmission</h2> <br>
<p>In Transmission, you are tasked with controlling transmitters around the map in order to send a signal for reinforcements before the other team.</p>
<p>Both teams have the same objective: to finish the transmission. If a team finishes the transmission first they win the wave. At the end of the game the team with more waves won wins overall.</p>
<p>Once a wave begins, three transmitters appear around the map. If you stand next to a transmitter you slowly start to capture it. Having several team members near you in the capture zone increases the speed at which you capture it. Each transmitter is able to transmit 0.5% of the overall transmission progress every second while they are controlled.</p>
<p>Remember that the transmitters are the most important thing in this mode! You cannot win if you do not control them, even if you kill members of the opposite team. Conversely, you will lose if the enemy controls transmitters for too long, even if you kill them all! There are several tools available to aid you in capturing them or preventing enemy control.</p>
<p>In Transmission you can use all special tools in the game. EMP guns can help you shut down an enemy transmitter, stopping them from transmitting temporarily. A backdoor may be used to immediately take over an enemy transmitter while reducing their progress. Drones can be used to capture transmitters remotely.</p>
<p>You can open the weapon loadout menu by pressing and holding the Garry's Mod spawnmenu key ('Q' by default). In this menu you can click each weapon slot to purchase other weapons, replacing the one in the slot with it. Every time you respawn you will spawn with the weapons in your loadout, but they will not be given to you until your next respawn, or if you purchase weapons before each wave.</p>]]

LANGUAGE.help_cont_introduction_collection			=	[[<h2>Collection</h2> <br>
<p>Collection mode involves the two teams attempting to collect blood samples for a potential zombie vaccine.</p>
<p>Samples can be earned by killing enemies. Headshots will make them drop twice the samples. If they were holding any samples, they will all be dropped upon dying.</p>
<p>Every 30 seconds, a zombie nest may spawn randomly on the map. Finding and destroying them gives some points, as well as making them drop 10 samples.</p>
<p>Simply collecting the samples is not enough. You need to find a research terminal and insert the samples into them. Standing near the research terminals will automatically insert the samples at a rate of 2 per second, but you cannot insert them into a terminal if there are any enemies within its radius.</p>
<p>You can open the weapon loadout menu by pressing and holding the Garry's Mod spawnmenu key ('Q' by default). In this menu you can click each weapon slot to purchase other weapons, replacing the one in the slot with it. Every time you respawn you will spawn with the weapons in your loadout, but they will not be given to you until your next respawn, or if you purchase weapons before each wave.</p>
<p>This mode makes getting up close and personal with your enemies more valuable, as long range sniping will not net you samples!</p>]]

LANGUAGE.help_cont_introduction_deathmatch			=	[[<h2>Deathmatch</h2> <br>
<p>In deathmatch mode there are no transmitters and the only objective is to kill the entire enemy team. You cannot use loadouts in this mode and everything is purchased using one simplified shop. Here, purchasing weapons and other tools will give them to you directly.</p>
<p>With deathmatch the entire game is faster paced, most tools are unavailable, and you have less time to complete the objective (which is to kill all enemies). Fortunately, all purchases are 30% cheaper!</p>
<p>You will also drop your weapons on death for the enemy to collect at their leisure, although there are specific circumstances:</p>
<ul><li>Weapons that show up as blue are <strong>"Insured"</strong>: You will not lose them upon death.</li> 
<li>Weapons will not be insured the first round you purchase them, but purchasing a weapon and surviving the following round holding it will insure them.</li>
<li>Consumables such as grenades or flashbangs, and tools such as forcefields that you place into the world, will never be insured. You will lose these every time.</li>
<li>Weapons you do not buy, such as those you get by picking them up from the ground, will never be insured.</li>

<li>More expensive weapons are generally more powerful, but it is crucial to manage your points and weapons.</li>
<li>Even helping your teammates kill the enemy will net you points. Over half the points from the kill will go to the person who dealt the final blow, but since you do get some points out of helping your teammates, teamwork is very lucrative.</li>
<li>Even the most expensive weapons will be less useful if you do not know how to make the most of them. Be sure to learn the weapons' special effects and general niche before jumping into a purchase.</li>
<li>Force field barriers are impervious except for their base. shoot them in the base to destroy them.</li>
<li>Scoring headshots mean more damage!</li>
<li>There is a slowing down effect if you get hit in the leg. If an enemy is charging at you try shooting them in the knees.</li>
<li>You do not collide nor deal damage to your teammates and can recognize them from the icon that appears over their heads.</li>

<li>Props that are nailed down will eventually explode when the nail's health reaches zero. There is no way to reuse props if this happens.</li>

</ul></p>
]]
LANGUAGE.help_cont_barricading						= [[<p><h3>Barricades are an important aspect of gameplay that can change the tide of battle.</h3></p>
<p>A well-built barricade and tight strategies will lead the team to victory.</p>

<p>Looking at a non-stationary prop and pressing the 'use' key (Default: E) will let you pick it up.<br>
Pressing down the 'walk' key (Default: Alt) will let you rotate the prop by moving your mouse, and pressing the 'run' key (Default: Shift) will hold the prop down in place.<br>
While holding the prop down, using the hammer's secondary attack or shooting the nailgun will nail the prop to whatever is behind it at the moment. Two props nailed together can move with each other, so to make a sturdy barricade props need to be nailed to stationary targets such as walls and floors.<br>
Hitting the prop with a hammer will repair it. Holding down the 'run' key (Default: Shift) will display all nails' current healths, given that they are nailed down by friendly players or yourself.
If a prop has been nailed down by mistake, or if you simply want to move the prop somewhere else, simply press the 'reload' key (Default:R) holding the hammer to pull out any nails placed by friendly players or yourself.
The health of the barricade depends on the props' mass and volume. A large, heavy prop has more health than small props.</p>
<p></p>
<hr>
<p>The 'Aegis' Barricade kit is a tool to quickly place a barricade on sturdy static surfaces. By turning the red indicator which tells you where the planks will go, you can place the planks by simply firing the kit. The indicator will turn green if you can place down the plank.<br>
Each plank placed down will use up one plank. These planks are different from nailed planks as they are treated like other placeables. Alongside turrets and forcefields, clever usage of these placeables alongside nailed barricades is a good way to build a sturdy barrier to control enemy movement.</p>

<p>Tips:
<ul>
<li>You can block pathways with heavy props but you won't be able to phase past them if they aren't nailed down. Remember to nail them down to finish the barricade!</li>
<li>Large, heavy props are good for barricades as the barricade will have more health, as well as allowing for more space for nails. You can put up to three nails into one prop, and each nail will increase its health.</li>
<li>Carpenter's Hammers are one of the most useful weapons ever. They can be used to build barricades, repair turrets and other placeables, restore turret ammunition, and even get rid of EMP effects on transmitters. An aspiring engineer should most certainly take one.</li>
<li>Barricades cannot be repaired indefinitely. Past a certain threshold barricades cannot be repaired, and once a barricade prop's health goes down to zero, it will break after a short period, being unable to nail back down. In other words, props are the limiting factor of barricades.</li>
<li>There are many methods of combating barricades. Weapons that deal AoE damage, such as explosives, can harm multiple props at once. Sledgehammers do more damage to barricades and placeable tools, and a crowbar can remove nails from barricades by hitting them. EMP guns can dissole all barricade nails entirely from a prop by shooting it.</li>
<li>Leaving holes inside your barricades for shooting at enemies is a good way to keep attacking the enemy while giving yourself some cover. Building a barricade in a strategic location, such as to block off pathways, is a surefire way to gain a strategic edge over your opponents.</li>
